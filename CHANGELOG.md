## [0.5.4]

### Fixed
- HexDocs source links pointed at the non-existent `main` branch — corrected to `master` so each `</>` glyph in generated docs opens the actual source file.

### Added
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — runs `mix test`, `mix format --check-formatted`, `mix credo --strict`, and `mix mob.security_scan` on push to master and on every PR.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — on tag push, creates a GitHub Release whose body is the matching `## [X.Y.Z]` section from this changelog.

## [0.5.3]

### Changed
- `guides/nifs.md` — rewrote the "Nx backends on mobile" section to match the current state (`mix mob.enable nxeigen` now real, `mix mob.enable mlx` includes the Metal GPU path on iOS device, EXLA "why not" preserved).
- `guides/nifs.md` — restructured the multi-Rust-NIF section to lead with [filmor's](https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler/issues/686) preferred shape (one Rustler crate per app, multiple `#[rustler::nif]` functions inside it). Multi-crate static linking remains supported and documented as an escape hatch, with the specific tradeoffs called out.

## [0.5.2]

### Added
- `mix mob.enable nxeigen` — wires NxEigen (Eigen C++ CPU backend) into a Mob app. Builds as a C++ `:static_nifs` entry, cross-compiled per arch (`arm64-ios`, `arm64-iossim`, `arm64-android`, `armv7a-android`). FFT support uses Eigen's bundled kissfft.
- EMLX Metal GPU enabled on iOS device. `lib/mob_dev/mlx_downloader.ex` now fetches the Metal-enabled `libmlx.a` + `mlx.metallib` bundle; `lib/mob_dev/native_build.ex#maybe_bundle_mlx_metallib/2` copies the precompiled kernel library into the .app at build time, so `EMLX.Backend` with `device: :gpu` works on device without runtime kernel compilation.
- `scripts/release/mlx/ios_device_metal.sh` + supporting build scripts for producing the Metal-enabled tarball; `scripts/release/mlx/patches/0001-ios-metal-build.patch` patches MLX 0.25.1's CMakeLists to switch SDK from `macosx` to `iphoneos` based on `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`.
